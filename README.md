`SHAPER` is a framework for defining, building, and evaluating generalized shape observables for collider physics, as defined in ["SHAPER: Can You Hear the Shape of a Jet?" (arxiv:2302.12266)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12266). This package can be used for evaluating an extremely large class of IRC-safe observables, with modules in place to define custom observables and jet algorithms using an intuitive geometric language.

Pictured: Example of a custom jet algorithm, "3-(Ellipse+Point)iness+Pileup", as evaluated on an example top jet, as the `SHAPER` algorithm computes the value of the observable and optimal parameters.

The `SHAPER` framework contains::

- Pre-built observables, including [N-subjettiness](https://inspirehep.net/literature/876746) and [isotropy](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1791220).
- Novel pre-built observables and jet algorithms for finding ring, disk, or ellipse-like jets, with optional centers for collinear radiation and optional pileup radiation
- Modules for defining arbitrary shape observables using parameterized manifolds, and building new complex observables from old ones.
- Modules for evaluating defined shape observables on event data, using the Sinkhorn divergence approximation of the Wasserstein metric. This returns both the shape value ("shapiness") and the optimal shape parameters.
- Modules for visualizing shape observables and their optimization, as in the GIF above.

## Installation

### From PyPI

In your Python environment run

```
python -m pip install pyshaper
# python -m pip install --upgrade 'pyshaper[all]'  # for all extras
```

### From this repository locally

In your Python environment from the top level of this repository run

```
python -m pip install .
# python -m pip install --upgrade '.[all]'  # for all extras
```

### From GitHub

In your Python environment run

```
python -m pip install "pyshaper @ git+https://github.com/rikab/shaper.git"
# python -m pip install --upgrade "pyshaper[all] @ git+https://github.com/rikab/shaper.git"  # for all extras
```

## Example Usage

For an example of how to use `SHAPER`, see the notebook `examples/example.ipynb`. This notebook contains example code for loading data, using pre-built shape observables, defining custom shape observables, running the `SHAPER` algorithm to evaluate these observables, and making plots.

To run the example, you will need to have `pyshaper` installed with all extras. This can be done using (assuming a PyPi installation):

```
python -m pip install --upgrade 'pyshaper[all]'
```

See the Installation section above for more details.

## Dependencies

To use `SHAPER`, the following packages must be installed as prerequisites:

- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch): A standard tensor operation library.
- [GeomLoss](https://www.kernel-operations.io/geomloss/): A library for optimal transport.
- [pyjet](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyjet): A package for jet clustering, needed for default observable definitions.
- [Energyflow](https://energyflow.network/): A suite of particle physics tools. This package is OPTIONAL; however, many of the example datasets within `SHAPER` require this package to load. Not necessary if you provide and format your own data. Included as part of the 'energyflow' extra.
- [imageio](https://pypi.org/project/imageio/): An image manipulation package. Needed for automatic gif creation -- not needed otherwise. Included as part of the 'viz' extra.
- Standard python packages: [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
