    "Now, we will construct some custom shape observables. A shape observable needs three major ingredients:\n",
    "* A sampler function: This is a function that takes in an integer $N$ and a dictionary of parameters. It returns a list of points (usually $N$ of them, but not necessarily) and weights that depend on the parameters and in principle should approximate the shape. The determination of these functions are where the \"science\" occurs.\n",
    "* A list of parameters: Shapes require parameters, which are used later for the sampler function. Parameters are/\"live on\" `Manifolds`, such as 2D coordinates, real numbers, simplexes, or circles (which are pre-defined, we won't worry about making new ones for now.). In the initialization of the observable, a dictionary of the form `{\"Parameter Name\": Manifold}` is required. Additionally, the parameters $\\beta$ and $R$ are required. An initialization scheme for the parameters is also required, but by default this is set to `kt`.\n",
    "* OPTIONALLY, a plotter function: `SHAPER` is capable of animating its own training process and producing event-by-event displays of shapes fitting onto events. These functions are used to render the shapes in `matplotlib`, which can be used to visualize individual shapes and is very useful for debugging custom shapes. However, this is often not necessary for physics analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will show three custom observables. First, we construct an observable, isotropy, which measures how uniform an event is. Isotropy is unique observable, as it does not require any parameters, making it extremely simple. Second, we will construct the observaled \"N-Point-Ellipsiness\" (This observable *already* exists in commonObservables; this is for illustrative purposes), which measures how much the event looks like ellipses with delta functions at their centers. This has a highly nontrivial parameterization. Finally, we will build a composite observable, \"N-Point-Ellipsiness Plus Pileup\", which combines the previous two observables with the addition operator. For this last observable, we will also show how to construct the optional plotter (note that for N-Point-Ellipsiness, the prebuilt version already has a plotter)\n"

    "Having defined observables, we can now calculate their values on our dataset using `SHAPER`. There are several options when using `SHAPER`:\n",
    "* `epochs`, `early_stopping`, and `early_stopping_fraction`: The first parameter is the maximum number of epochs the algorithm is allowed to run. The second is how many epochs to wait without improvement to end the algorithm early (25 by default) for each event. If running on many events in a single batch, the last parameter is the fraction of events that need to be considered done (reached `early_stopping` epochs) before the algorithm finished (0.95 by default). It is useful to set this slghtly below 1.00, since there are always a handful of events that take a while to incrementally improve, but these events are \"good enough\" by the time the rest of the other 95% converge. \n",
    "* `N` (default is 100) is passed to each shape observable's sampler function. Typically, this is used to specify how many points should be randomly generated per shape, though this can be used for anything (or not at all) in custom samplers.\n",
    "* `epsilon` (default is 0.001) is the Sinkhorn approximation parameter, and `scaling` (default is 0.9) is the annealing parameter. Both these parameters affect runtime versus precision. If using a GPU, it is highly recommended not to reduce epsilon below 0.001, as machine precision will negatively affect your results.\n",
    "* `lr` (default is .01) is the learning rate for the ADAM optimizer, used to optimize shape parameters. As of `SHAPER v1.0.0`, ADAM is the only supported optimizer.\n",
    "* `verbose` prints to the screen. If a `plot_dictionary` is specified, event displays for each event will be rendered and saved in `matplotlib` after training. If a shape observable has an associated plotter function, this will be used to render the shape on top of the event (useful for debugging and showing example results). If a gif directory is specified, an animation of the entire minimization process will be generated. Note that rendering is resource intensive and is only recommended to do for a small (ten or less) number of events at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SHAPER` will process each observable one at a time. For each observable, `SHAPER` will process the entire batch of events in parallel. When running `SHAPER` with the `verbose` option, a new line will print for epoch, and print the percentage of events considered \"done\", as defined by the early stopping procedure. The percentage done will remain at 0% until at least `early_stopping` epochs have passed, after which it will begin to rise. It will continue to rise until either it reaches `early_stopping_fraction` or the total number of epochs reaches `epochs`, after which `SHAPER` will save the lowest EMDs and corresponding parameters for each event, and move on to the next observable. For trivial observables (those with no parameters, or all parameters frozen, such as isotropy), only a single epoch is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The running time will depend heavily on your computing architecture. If running on an old laptop CPU, this calculation should take 5-10 minutes for 50 events. If running on a GPU, which can be enabled as shown in the Imports section, it will be much faster, and the batch size can be considerably increased for a faster runtime per event.\n",
